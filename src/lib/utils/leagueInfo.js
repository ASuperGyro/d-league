  <p>The future is now old men. We have blown past the desire for a simple magazine and have turned our attention to a website to house the D League expereince.</p>
  <p>This will act as a sort of hub for the D League that contains different information all in one place. You can use it as a companion app to Sleeper, and you will still need to use Sleeper for setting rosters, but this will contain records, matchups, player activity, news, etc etc. A lot of it is pulled from Sleepers API so it should be accurate. It should also be able to house the magazines in one place once I figure that out. Maybe.</p>
  <p>This website is going to be a work in progress. Coding is not my forte so if anyone wants to get down and dirty I'm running this in GitHub. Svelte is what most of the coding is based on, but HTML should be plenty. If stuff breaks with the coding, good luck to me troubleshooting. I'm more likely to just restart the whole thing.</p>
  <p>Thank me later,</p>
